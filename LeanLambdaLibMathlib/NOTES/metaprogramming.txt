i think i will need to use the Qq library
Qq is part of mathlib, and also mathlib has some extra stuff for it. see:
https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Qq/Macro.html
https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Qq/Match.html
https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Util/Qq.html

also Qq itself: https://github.com/leanprover-community/quote4



wait maybe you don't need Qq, how about:

stuff i've learned about lean metaprogramming that they don't tell you in the tutorials
- you can only construct and match syntax with `(thing $bla) notation IF IT IS IN term scope.
