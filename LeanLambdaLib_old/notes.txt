in this repo, i'm going to build the final version of my thesis project.

[ ] - define lambda calculus with nice human readable and writable syntax (beta and eta (actually do i need eta?)).
[ ] - prove confluence
[ ] - build higher order unification automation
[ ] - build general recursion library
[ ] - define embedding and logical predicate, using both the lambda stuff and the general rec library
[ ] - make a sweet proof of canonicity
[ ] - maybe consider expanding to weak or strong normalization somehow
