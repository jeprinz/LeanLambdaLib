i think i will need to use the Qq library
Qq is part of mathlib, and also mathlib has some extra stuff for it. see:

https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Qq/Match.html
https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/Mathlib/Util/Qq.html

also Qq itself: https://github.com/leanprover-community/quote4
